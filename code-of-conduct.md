# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Values

- **Be respectful.**

In particular, respect differences of opinion.

- **Be patient.**

Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)

- **Be responsible.**

What you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Public or private harassment

- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
