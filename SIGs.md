# Participate in community SIGs

The Vanus community is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and developers can choose a SIG they are interested in contributing to. You can become a member, reviewer, or approver of SIG, and different roles have different permissions and entail specific responsibilities for approving and committing changes.
